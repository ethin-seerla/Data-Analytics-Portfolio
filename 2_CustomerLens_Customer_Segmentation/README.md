#  CustomerLens: Market Segmentation and Targeted Strategy for Retail

# Business Scenario
This project simulates a Deloitte-style consulting engagement for a retail client aiming to improve marketing efficiency.  
The company wants to understand customer purchasing behavior to target promotions more effectively.

#  Objectives
- Clean and preprocess customer demographic and transaction data  
- Apply clustering algorithms to identify unique customer segments  
- Visualize customer clusters and behavioral patterns  
- Recommend marketing and pricing strategies for each segment  

#  Tech Stack
Python | pandas | scikit-learn | matplotlib | seaborn | Power BI / Streamlit

#  Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing — Handle missing values, standardize features, encode categorical data.  
2. Feature Engineering — Create features such as Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM).  
3. Modeling — Use K-Means and PCA for clustering and dimensionality reduction.  
4. Visualization — Plot cluster distributions and RFM metrics.  
5. Insights & Recommendations — Present findings via dashboard/report.

# Example Cluster Insights
| Cluster | Description | Key Strategy |

| 1 | Discount Seekers | Targeted coupon campaigns |
| 2 | Infrequent Buyers | Re-engagement offers & reminders |
| 3 | Potential Churn | Loyalty points & personalized communication |
