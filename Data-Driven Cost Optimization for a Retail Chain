# ProfitPulse: Data-Driven Cost Optimization for a Retail Chain

## Overview
ProfitPulse is a data-driven consulting project focused on identifying profit leakages and improving cost efficiency for a retail business. The goal is to analyze sales data, detect underperforming product categories, and provide actionable strategies to improve profitability and decision-making.

## Business Scenario
Imagine you are a Deloitte data consultant hired by a mid-sized retail chain. Despite growing sales, profits are declining in some product categories. Your role is to:
1. Diagnose the causes of profit decline.
2. Forecast demand for key product lines.
3. Recommend cost optimization strategies using data insights.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales, profit, and discount data by product, category, and region.
- Identify low-margin and underperforming products.
- Forecast demand for top-selling items.
- Build an interactive dashboard for executive decision-making.

## Tech Stack
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Forecasting: Prophet or ARIMA
- Dashboard: Streamlit or Power BI
- Reporting: Jupyter Notebook and PowerPoint/PDF report

## Key Insights (Expected)
- Around 15% of products generate nearly 80% of total profit (Pareto principle).
- Discounts higher than 20% significantly reduce overall profit margins.
- Certain regions show consistent seasonal spikes in the Furniture category.
